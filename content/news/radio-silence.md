For anyone wondering where the next track is, Dreamguns has been temporarily out of action, the alter ego he shares his life with had to wrestle back control for a while to keep things ticking along

On top of this there have been many vocal maladies since the last recording, vocal range is currently down 35.7% and mucus production is up a nauseating 42.3%. Surgeons have been consulted, cameras have been thrust into nasal passages, waiting lists for non-emergency surgery have been incremented

The next track exists in demo form, it will be called "You're gonna have to give me more than that Gordon", a story of oneirological miscommunication from beyond the grave
